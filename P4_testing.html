<h2 class="head">3. Testing Document </h2>
<p> The goal of our questions were to find out how easy it was to navigate and to find the information you were looking for. We thought that the best way to get many answers was by having a short test with few questions and divide the test in three parts, the first asking for information about the tester, the second part rating the website from 1-5 with a numbers of questions. The last part is more open, where we ask the tester for things we could have done different and things they liked. </p> </div>
<div>
<h2 class="head">4. Tester Audience</h2>
<p>Our testing audience was mainly students since we posted our testing scheme to our fellow students on Informatikks facebook page. In a way this is just the persons we are looking for to test our page since this is the groupe of people it is intended for. The problem with only having posted it on the Informtikk facebook page is that people studding Informatikk are above average when it comes to IT knowledge. That’s why we also did two “live” tests where we could observe the person navigating through the webpage. If we had more time we would have done more tests like this, because this was a very good way to see where the problems of the webpage were. Some facts about the participants: 1 person is under 16 years old, 10 persons between 18-21, 2 persons between 22-25, 1 person between 31-40 years old and 2 persons over 40 years of age. Most of our participants are students (10 out of 16), 5 persons are working full-time, and 1 person is still in school. 9 of the participants are male, 6 women and 1 person did not specify gender.

<h2 class="head">5. Testing Platforms</h2>
<p>The website was tested on Safari, Chrome, IE and Firefox. People with IPhone and Samsung has also tested the page on their phones. </p></div>
<div>
<h2 class="head">6. Feedback Summary</h2>
<p>We got some usefull feedback from the Google Form. People mostly said that the page was easy to navigate and had a clean design, which was something we urged for. Some of the critic was going towards the viewport on mobile phones and it was difficult to navigate on the mobile device. Some were saying that there should be more information and tips on some of the pages. But the most useful feedback we got was from the two persons doing “live” testing, then we discovered that both of them didn’t know that we had more pictures of the hybler in hybel.html. One of them wanted better information about how to deliver an application for the hybler. Both found that the navigation between the pages was good. <br><br>

On the question: "Til hvilken grad var det mulig å se hva som var hovedpoenget med hver side?" 12 out of 16 participants answered ether 4 or 5. Of the people who answered lower than 4 or 5 one person was between 18-21 years old, one was 22-25, one was 31-40 and the last person was under 16 years old. Even though we want everyone to know the purpose of each web page we have to be saticfied with such a high number of 4 or 5. Even more satisfied when both people live-testing could tell what our intentions on the page were. <br><br>

Question 2 “Til hvilken grad var det lett å finne informasjon på nettsiden?” Everyone except one person answered 4 or 5. This is a result we are very glad to see, because this was one of the main intensions with the page. To make it easy for students to find information. The “live testers” also pointed out that information was easy to get. <br><br>

Question 3 “Virket nettsiden intuitiv?” Only four people rated this question with a score under 4. Of course our goal is to make a page which is intuitive for every user, but we cannot be dissatisfied with a result like this. <br><br>

Question 4 “Fant du informasjonen du lette etter?” Is an important question and we are happy that 12 out of 16 found this to be good (4 or 5 in score). Two of the persons who were asked gave it score 1. Although this is very sad one of the two persons have rated every question except one with the score 1, so it is possible to think that this person ether is having a bad day or has little or none technical experience. When we asked questions to the live testers and had them to find different info they managed this very good. The only bad thing was that, when asked to find more pictures of the hybler, one of the participants did not manage this without us asking directly for her to find some more pictures. <br><br>

Question 5 and 6 “Dersom du brukte nettsiden på mobil, i hvilken grad virket nettsiden intuitiv?” and 
“Dersom du brukte nettsiden på mobil, var siden lett å navigere gjennom?” where to users who used the website on their mobile phone. On both of the questions 11 people answered but the result here was not as good as we could have hoped. Under 50% of the asked thought that the page was easy to navigate through with mobile (scores under 4). Also the live testers were noticeably more unsure when navigating. This was critics we were prepared for because this was something we didn’t put enough time into.

<h2 class="head">7. Your Resonse </h2>
<p> Our response to the feedback would have been to fix up in some of the things the people participation mentioned. To start with we would have made it more reactive for mobile users. This could have been done if we had more time, a few were mentioning that the styling were similar to Sit´s own styling. This was because the client specifically asked us to keep some of the styles they had so they could just melt the page into their systems without having to do much work. On the basis of the feedback, we could have done some more work showing that there were more pictures of the different hybels. Maybe by adding some text like “click here to view more pictures”. If we had more time we could have added some more tips for students and put in better information about where to apply for the hybel. </p> </div>
<div>
<h2 class="head">8. Reflection </h2>
<p> Throughout the project we have learned a lot about HTML, CSS and Javascript. For some of the group members all of this was complete new, while for others they had done some of it before. We have divided the work so that the persons with the highest skills have done the more difficult parts. We have used many hours on the website and the final product is a user friendly website with some nice functionalities. Everyone in the group has done their parts and worked very good the last days to complete the website. Looking back, we should have started making the page more reactive on mobile phones before. Also, we should have started with the coding part before, than we could have avoided some of the late nights the week before deadline.</p> </div>
