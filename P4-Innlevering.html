<h2 class="head">3. Testing Document </h2>
<p> The goal of our questionnaire was to find out how easy it is to navigate and find information on the website. We created a short questionnaire with few questions, and divided it into three parts. The first part asked for general information about the participant. In the second part, the participant was asked to rate various aspect of the website from 1-5. In the third and final part, the participant was asked to give feedback on things that they liked, or things that could have been done differently. Here is a link to our testing document: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ueh5w7WQYEVgrkxc1eSl8Y-mafLhMpuWHibHEbl6J08/edit#gid=502117524">Click here</a>

<h2 class="head">4. Tester Audience</h2>
<p>As our testing scheme was posted on the facebook page of “Informatikk”, our participants consisted mainly of students. This is positive, as our website is created for student. However, the people that are member of this facebook group are studying informatics, and thus, we can assume that they have an above average interest in and knowledge of IT. Because of this, we also carried out two “live” tests, where we could observe the person navigating through the page. If we had more time we would have done more tests like this, as this turned out to be a good way to identify what worked and what did not on the webpage. <br><br>
Some facts about the participants: 1 person was under 16 years old, 10 people were between the age of 18 and 21, 2 people were between 22 and 25, 1 person between 31-40 years old and 2 over the age of 40. Most of our participants were students (10 out of 16), 5 were working full-time, and 1 person is still in school. 9 of the participants were male, 6 were female and 1 person did not specify gender.

<h2 class="head">5. Testing Platforms</h2>
<p>The website was tested on Safari, Chrome, IE and Firefox. People with IPhone and Samsung have also tested the page on their phones. </p></div>
<div>
<h2 class="head">6. Feedback Summary</h2>
<p>We got some useful feedback from the Google Form. People mostly said that the page was easy to navigate and had a clean design, which was something we urged for. We received some critique on the viewport on mobile phones and that it was difficult to navigate on the mobile device. Some were saying that there should be more information and tips on some of the pages. The most useful feedback we got was from the two people doing “live” testing. Here, we discovered that none of them knew that we had more pictures of the hybler in hybel.html. One of them wanted better information on how to apply for the hybler. Both found that the navigation between the pages was good. <br><br>

On the question: "Til hvilken grad var det mulig å se hva som var hovedpoenget med hver side?" 12 out of 16 participants answered either 4 or 5. Of the people who answered lower than 4 or 5 one person was between 18-21 years old, one was 22-25, one was 31-40 and the last person was under 16 years old. Even though we want everyone to know the purpose of each web page we have to be satisfied with such a high number of 4 or 5.  Both of the people live-testing could tell what the intention of the page was. <br><br>

Question 2 “Til hvilken grad var det lett å finne informasjon på nettsiden?” Everyone except one person answered 4 or 5. This is a result we are very glad to see, because this was one of our main objectives with the page: to make it easy for students to find information. The people testing live, also pointed out that information was easily accessible. <br><br>

Question 3 “Virket nettsiden intuitiv?” Only four people rated this question with a score under 4. Of course our goal is to make a page which is intuitive for every user, but we cannot be dissatisfied with a result like this. <br><br>

Question 4 “Fant du informasjonen du lette etter?” is an important question and we are happy that 12 out of 16 found this to be good (4 or 5 in score). Two of the people asked gave it score 1. Although this is very sad one of the two rated every question except one with the score 1, so it is possible to think that this person was either having a bad day or had little or none technical experience. When we asked questions to the live testers and had them look for different information they managed this very well. The only bad thing was that, when asked to find more pictures of the hybler, one of the participants did not manage this without us asking directly for her to find some more pictures. <br><br>

Question 5 and 6 “Dersom du brukte nettsiden på mobil, i hvilken grad virket nettsiden intuitiv?” and “Dersom du brukte nettsiden på mobil, var siden lett å navigere gjennom?” were directed to the participant who used the website on their mobile phones. On both of the questions 11 people answered but the result here was not as good as we would have hoped. Under 50% of the asked thought that the page was easy to navigate through with mobile (scores under 4). Also the live testers were noticeably more unsure when navigating using their phones. This was critique that we were prepared for because this was something we did not put enough time into.

<h2 class="head">7. Our Response </h2>
<p> Our response to the feedback would have been to fix some of the things the participants mentioned. To start with we would have made it more reactive for mobile users. This could have been done if we had more time. A few mentioned that the styling was similar to Sit´s own styling. This was because the client specifically asked us to keep some of the styles they had so they could just melt the page into their systems without having to do too much work. On the basis of the feedback, we could have done some more work showing that there were more pictures of the different hybels. Maybe by adding some text like “click here to view more pictures”. If we had more time we could have added some more tips for students and put in better information about where to apply for the hybel.

<h2 class="head">8. Reflection </h2>
<p> Throughout the project we have learned a lot about HTML, CSS and Javascript. For some of the group members all of this was completely new, while others had done some of it before. We have divided the work so that the people with the highest skills have done the more difficult parts. We have used many hours on the website and the final product is a user friendly website with some nice functionalities. Everyone in the group has done their parts and worked very good the last days to complete the website. Looking back, we should have started earlier making the page more reactive on mobile phones. Also, we should have started with the coding part earlier. This way we could have avoided some of the late nights the week before deadline.
